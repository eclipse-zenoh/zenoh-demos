# A zenoh Rust teleop application for ROS2

## **Requirements**

* A [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) environment
* A [zenoh router](http://zenoh.io/docs/getting-started/quick-test/)
* The [zenoh/DDS bridge](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-plugin-dds#trying-it-out)
* ROS2 [turtlesim](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlesim) (or any other robot able to receive Twist messages...)

-----

## **Usage**

### How to build

```bash
cargo build
```

### How to run

A simple teleop client publishing Twists via zenoh, bridged to ROS2.

1. Start the turtlesim:

     ```bash
     ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
     ```

2. Start the zenoh router:

     ```bash
     zenohd
     ```

3. Start the zenoh/DDS bridge:

     ```bash
     zenoh-bridge-dds
     ```

4. Start Ros2Teleop

     ```bash
     ./target/debug/ros2-teleop
     ```

5. Use the arrows keys to drive the robot

See more use cases in [this blog](https://zenoh.io/blog/2021-04-28-ros2-integration/).

**Notes**:

See all options accepted by Ros2Teleop with:

```bash
./target/debug/ros2-teleop -h
```

By default ros2-teleop publishes Twist messages on topic `rt/turtle1/cmd_vel` (for turtlesim).
For other robot, change the topic using the `--cmd_vel` option:

```bash
./target/debug/ros2-teleop -cmd_vel rt/my_robot/cmd_vel
```

Both zenoh router and Teleop can be deployed in different networks than the robot. Only the zenoh/DDS bridge has to run in the same network than the robot (for DDS communication via UDP multicast).  
For instance, you can:

* deploy the zenoh router in a cloud on a public IP with port 7447 open
* configure the zenoh bridge to connect this remote zenoh router:

     ```bash
     zenoh-bridge-dds -m client -e tcp/<cloud_ip>:7447
     ```

* configure Ros2Teleop to connect this remote zenoh router:

    ```bash
    ./target/debug/ros2-teleop -m client -e tcp/<cloud_ip>:7447
    ```
