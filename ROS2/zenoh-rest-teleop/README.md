# Some examples of using Zenoh REST API for ROS2

## **Requirements**

* A [zenoh router](http://zenoh.io/docs/getting-started/quick-test/)
* The [zenoh/DDS bridge](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-plugin-dds#trying-it-out)
* [jscdr](https://github.com/atolab/jscdr)
   (automatically retrieved by your Web browser)
* ROS2 [turtlesim](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlesim) (or any other robot able to receive Twist messages...)

-----

## **Usage**

### ros2-teleop.html

A simple teleop web page allowing to publish Twists and to subscribe to Logs
via the zenoh REST API, bridged to ROS2.

1. Start the turtlesim:

     ```bash
     ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
     ```

2. Start the zenoh/DDS bridge, activating its REST API:

     ```bash
     zenoh-bridge-dds --rest-http-port 8000
     ```

3. Open the `ros2-teleop.html` file in a Web browser

4. In this page:

     * If needed, adapt the "URL of your zenoh-bridge-dds" to the host where your bridge is running
     * Click on "Subscribe" button
     * All the messages published on "\<scope\>/rosout" via ROS2 should be displayed in the bottom box.
