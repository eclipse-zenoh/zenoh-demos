        <h1>Zero Overhead Network Protocol</h1>
        <p>Zenoh /zeno/ is a pub/sub/query protocol unifying data in motion, data
            at rest and computations. It elegantly blends traditional pub/sub with
            geo distributed storage, queries and computations, while retaining a
            level of time and space efficiency that is well beyond any of the
            mainstream stacks.</p>
